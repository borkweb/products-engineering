## <a id="js-style"></a> Code style

All javascript should be well documented. Functions, namespaces should adhere to the jsdoc 3 standard, available here: [[http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html]].

Inside functions declare additional comments with the // syntax.

### Variable declaration

Variable declarations should be comma separated:

	var v, x, y;
	
	var $this = $(this),
	    $that = $(that),
	    i = 0;

_**NOTE:** Watch for implicit globals when declaring your variables. This is a very common issue,
especially with iterators in javascript loops. Leaking these to global scope can yield unexpected
results._

Utility functions, state, tests and options for the main plugins should be stored in
`tribe-events.js` and `tribe-events-pro.js`. 

If functions or portions of functionality move between plugins, make sure all associated js code
moves to that new area with them.

## <a id="js-event-namespacing"></a> Event namespacing

To promote flexible event handling within jQuery, [namespacing events](https://api.jquery.com/event.namespace/) is preferred over prefixing custom event names. 

### Why?

Namespacing allows a developer to add and remove events in an isolated fashion.  CSS-Tricks has [an excellent write-up](https://css-tricks.com/namespaced-events-jquery/) about why they are awesome.

### Namespacing conventions

Namespaced custom events should use the following convention:

	[event name].[plugin slug].tribe

#### [event name]

The `[event name]` should be something that indicates the action that is occurring. If saving a ticket, an event name of `saveTicket` would be appropriate - `fryBacon` would not.


#### [plugin slug]

Replace `[plugin slug]` with the appropriate plugin slug.  Examples:

	$( document ).trigger( 'saveTicket.tec.tribe' );
	$( document ).on( 'saveEvent.events-community.tribe', function() {} );
	$( document ).off( 'fetchEvents.events-pro.tribe' );

Plugin slugs of note:

* The Events Calendar: `tec`
* Events Pro: `events-pro`
* Events Community: `events-community`
* Events Eventbrite: `events-eventbrite`
* Events Facebook: `events-facebook`
* etc.

__NOTE:__ There should be some debate on what the TEC slug should be. Some other options that have been proposed: `events-core`, `the-events-calender`, `events`, and `core`. I'm guessing there'll be more.

#### tribe

This is the piece of the namespace that should be present everywhere. It separates our events from those of other plugins.
